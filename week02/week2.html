            The article Long Live the Web is an interesting read because Tim Berners-Lee mentions many things about the internet
            that isn't thought of or discussed much nowadays such as the principle that it was built upon, and his worries about 
            internet surveilance that still exists today. It was also interesting to se how Lee was right about universality as it
            is hard to imagine any tech company's product not being connected to the web, it is even easier to just make their product
            in a web wrapper as spotify and steam does.
