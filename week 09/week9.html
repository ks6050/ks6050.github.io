                The Social Dilemma is an interesting watch because it explains how social media is designed to constantly pull you back 
                in using engagement tactics. What stood out the most to me was the idea that every tap or pause becomes a signal that teaches 
                the algorithm what to feed you next. It isn’t just random content showing up on your screen; it’s a system that is always 
                adjusting itself based on what keeps you there the longest.
                <br><br>
                It is interesting to think about that you can actually manipulate this process. By only interacting with specific types of posts, 
                you can train the app to show you more of what you care about, even though most people don’t realize they are shaping their own 
                bubble in real time.
                <br><br>
                It makes you think about how easily your online experience can be shaped by the smallest interactions, and how much of what you see is 
                influenced by systems working behind the scenes without you ever noticing.
