            For my final project, I want to create a small web game inspired by
            brotato which is a vampire survivor like game. It will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            The game will start with a simple menu where the player chooses between
            three character classes. Each class will have small differences in stats and abilities.
            The core gameplay will focus on moving around the screen, collecting items, and trying
            to survive waves of enemies. My goal is to make something simple, responsive, and fun
            while also showing what I learned this semester.
