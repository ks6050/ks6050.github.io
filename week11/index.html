      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <h3>Week 1 - Week 2</h3>
      <p>
        Started off with playing around with the things that we were taught in class, it was fun
        creating the silly websites and getting familiar with HTML and CSS which is very different
        from other coding languages.
      </p>

      <h3>Week 3 - Week 5</h3>
      <p>
        This is when I started to use what we've learned to start implementing designs. For week 3
        I imitated the formatting of the reading, and for week 5 I used things like hover and transform
        to change the perspective of the background painting.
      </p>

      <h3>Week 6 - Week 8</h3>
      <p>
        Around this time I started getting more comfortable adding interactivity instead of just layout
        changes. For the Whole Earth assignment I played with JavaScript for the first time,
        using it to switch images and make the carousel work.
      </p>

      <h3>Week 9 - Week 10</h3>
      <p>
        These weeks helped me understand JavaScript on a deeper level, especially how to update the page based on 
        user actions. Building the Social Dilemma-inspired interaction showed me how to use simple logic to change 
        what appears on screen, and the anonymous thread project helped me think about structure and how comments get
         added dynamically. It was also when I felt my weaknesses the most, mainly debugging, but it made me better at 
         slowing down and reading my code more carefully.
