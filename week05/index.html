            <p class="p1 aldrich-regular">The series Ways of Seeing is an interesting watch because John Berger 
                talks about how the way we look at art and images is shaped by culture, history, and even advertising. 
                He explains that seeing isn’t just about eyesight but also about how context changes what we extract from the artwork.
                It was also interesting to see how he broke down the “male gaze” and how women are often shown as objects 
                to be looked at instead of people with their own perspective. What stood out the most was how his ideas still 
                apply today especially on social media where there is a prevalent culture of judging and comparing.
                It makes you think about how much of what we see is influenced by things we don’t even realize.</p>
