                The article The Medium Is the Message is an interesting read because Marshall McLuhan 
                talks about how the form of communication itself affects people more than the actual 
                content being shared. He explains that new technology changes how we think and interact, 
                not just what we say. It was also interesting to see how McLuhan was somewhat, since today the 
                internet and social media have completely changed how people view information. The idea that 
                the medium shapes our world feels true when you think about how much phones and online platforms
                control our daily lives, even more than the messages they carry. However I do feel that McLuhan is
                perhaps a bit to nihlistic because he talks about technology and media like they completely control 
                how people think and live, almost like we donâ€™t have any real choice in it. It feels like he sees 
                humans as just reacting to whatever new medium shows up instead of shaping it ourselves.
